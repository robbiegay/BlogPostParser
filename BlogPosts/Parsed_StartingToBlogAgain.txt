<h3 className="text-center">Starting to blog again</h3>

<p>
	During the Awesome Inc bootcamp in 2019, we were all challenged to keep a weekly blog. This is something I really enjoyed -- and that I kept at for a few months after the bootcamp (monthly posts until May 2020). I made one more post in May of 2021 and have not posted since.
</p>

<p>
	I have a few topics I have been writing about (mostly reviews/summarys of technical books), and I thought I would start the blog back up. When thinking about posting again, I looked at some old posts and realized that I missed the personal side of blogging -- sharing small updates about what has been going on in my life.
</p>

<p>
	To get the blog back up, I have to do a few things:
</p>

<p>
	- Some general mainence and updates to the website
</p>

<p>
	- Writing a few blog posts:
</p>

<p>
		- A post saying that I will be posting again (this post!)
</p>

<p>
		- Year in Review posts for 2020, 2021, 2022, and a short post of what has been going on so far in 2023
</p>

<p>
		- A post talking about my "read more technical books" goal
</p>

<p>
		- Adding a few already written reviews/summaries of technical books as posts to this blog
</p>

<p>
	- Create a utility script that will parse a text file (blog post) into some html: <a>link</a>. I used to write the blog post and then manually format them into html. I am hoping to streamline my blog writing a little bit by writing this utility program
</p>

<p>
	I'm exciting to be posting on this site again! Check out my year in review below:
